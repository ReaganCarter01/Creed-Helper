									<p>&ldquo;If I want to get rich/more wealth, I would go for getting multiples of the same Pokemon (Hoards) and trade them for extra value because they are bulk. People will pay more for what they are worth individually if they are in a bulk.&rdquo;</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="posted">By Dualot</p>
									<p>&ldquo;If you have quantity over quality, don't trade them all for one or two pokes, split them off, trade them for hoards, make profit! Nowadays, "upgrades" (trading many things for one Poke) is not very wise, the smaller promos are much easier to trade off and have more chance to rise in value! Because once you have one rare/big poke, it will be hard to trade it off.&rdquo;</p>

								<h2>Helpful tips for Pokemon Creed</h2>
								<span class="byline">By Dualot</span>
							</header>
							<p>Gambling is bad, it is a good thing when you win, but when you lose big bets, it's game over. I do not recommend. Work your way up without the use of luck in betting. I also do not encourage gambling on this game, it is not a casino.</p>
							<p>I do not recommend selling Pokemon for coins, coins are only good for buying the promo's nothing else. Coins lose value, whilst Pokemon only gain value. Coins can be easily bought, hacked, or abused, so that is why you should keep your promos and let them rise in value.</p>
							<p>There are many types of people in the game, people who play the game honestly, and those who play dirty. The people who play honestly will have more benefits all the way through the game, and those who don't, may have benefits in the short term, but will soon fall. The people who try to act smart I will not get along with.</p>
							<p> </p>
							<p> </p>
							<p> Bonus Tip: There are Pokemon which are much more liked and popular and may not go with the rate on the rate list, so those can sometimes be charged more for their value.So here's an example why Pokemon is worth more:
								Player A has The Pokemon "X" worth lets say 5k coins. If they sell it for 5k coins, that 5k coins will just be 5k coins. But rates are changing, and that Pokemon "X" might then in the future worth 20k coins, and you would have made a 15k loss.
								When trading, normally pokemon sprites with a nice sprite is more popular and people may be more willing to pay more for it. </p>
