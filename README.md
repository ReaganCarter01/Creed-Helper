# Creed-Helper

Creed helper is a helper website I made during my free time for a game I play. 



# How it works

The website connects to Pokemon Creed's apis, https://pokemoncreed.net/ajax/pokedex.php?pokemon=' and https://pokemoncreed.net/ajax/box.php?user
 
 Once valid infomation is taken from the user it calculated and returned giving the value of the Pokemon or box.


# Features

## Box Rater:

This allows the user to copy and paste there box and will calculate the value of the Pokemon
