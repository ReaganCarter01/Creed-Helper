# Creed-Helper

Creed helper is a helper website I made during my free time for a game I play. 

[CreedHelper](http://creedhelper.byethost7.com)


# How it works

The website connects to Pokemon Creed's apis, https://pokemoncreed.net/ajax/pokedex.php?pokemon=' and https://pokemoncreed.net/ajax/box.php?user
 
 Once valid infomation is taken from the user it calculated and returned giving the value of the Pokemon or box.


# Features

## Level Calulator:

A simple calulator that converts levels to exp or exp to levels based on the level formula.

## Box Rater:

This allows the user to copy and paste there box and will calculate the value of the Pokemon.

## User Rater:

This takes the users input and will find the given user and will calulate their box and will show the pokemon in the user's box as well
